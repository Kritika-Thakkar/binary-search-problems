#You are given integers n and m representing a board of size n by m. You also have an unlimited number of 1 by 2 dominos. Return the maximum number of dominos that can be placed on the board such that they don't overlap and every domino lies entirely within the board.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, m):
        size=m*n
        num=int(0.5*size)
        return num
